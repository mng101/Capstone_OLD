    The following code works perfectly when included in models.py
    and fails when copied to this signals.py file
    Will work with models.py file for now, and come back if time permits

# def create_user_account(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
#     if created:
#         Account.objects.create(user=instance)
#         print('Account created')
#
# post_save.connect(create_user_account, sender=User)
